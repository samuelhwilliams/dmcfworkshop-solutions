## Exercise 2 (1 minute)
1) Find out what spaces you have access to.
   * If you're SC cleared and don't have access to three spaces, talk to a CF DM Org Manager after the workshop.
      * `cf org-users digitalmarketplace`
2) Re-target the Sandbox space, just to be sure.

## Available commands
* `cf login`
* `cf logout`
* `cf orgs`
* `cf org-users`
* `cf spaces`
* `cf target`
