## Exercise 7 (5-10 minutes)
1) An application has been deployed for you, but it has a pretty nasty bug in it that's causing extremely slow requests. The bug has been reverted and the correct code is in the `/app` folder alongside this README.md.
2) Carefully, and without causing any downtime/request failures, deploy the new app and retire the existing one. After the blue/green deploy, your new app should end up with identical name/specs to the existing app.
3) After you're finished, clean up any resources you've used or created.
