## Exercise 9 (20 minutes)
1) You've been given a couple of applications that need to be deployed on the PaaS. The code is in the `code/` directory.
2) Using everything covered today and your general developer prowess, finish the manifest that will deploy these apps alongside a Postgres database and link everything up so that they function correctly, then log into an account to complete the lab.
4) After you're finished, clean up any resources you've used or created.
