## Exercise 4 (10-15 minutes)
**Note**: If CF CLI suggests you restage the application, use restart instead. It's sufficient for this exercise and much faster.

1) Find the app that has been created for you.
2) Connect to your app in a web browser.
3) Investigate and explore until you can reach a page that says "Exercise complete".
4) After you've finished, go ahead and clean up and CloudFoundry resources you've used or created.
