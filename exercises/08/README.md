## Exercise 8 (10-15 minutes)
1) You're about to have a bad day. A dev on your team has just deployed an update to your app that doesn't seem to have gone smoothly. Make a note of any problems you discover and what caused them.
2) Using the CF CLI and other skills you've acquired as a mighty developer, investigate what's happened and make the relevant fix(es) to bring the app online again.
3) Be on the lookout for a well-wishing colleague who tries to help fix your app but causes more problems in the process.
3) Keep going until your app is stable and you're marked as complete on the leaderboard.
4) After you're finished, clean up any resources you've used or created.
